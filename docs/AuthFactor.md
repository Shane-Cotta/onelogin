```python
from onelogin.models.auth_factor import AuthFactor

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of AuthFactor from a JSON string
auth_factor_instance = AuthFactor.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print AuthFactor.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
